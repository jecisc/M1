Why do you think poeple launch theire company?

In my opinion, a lot a persons who really launch theire company do it because they do not find a company matching theire ideas or mindset. Some want to work on something that does not exist, at least where they are. Some do not like to be part of a big society because they do not like the system in those. In a lot of company running since many years have some strict  rules and some poeple just don't like those. Thus they prefer to launch there own company that will match theire ideas.
I think that really few poeple do it for money or to be the boss, even if most poeple might think of launching one for those reasons. I think this because they want it for selfish reasons but in the fact the person who launch the company is the one that will work the most and get the most problems.
